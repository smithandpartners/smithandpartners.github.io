I have lived with and loved dogs my whole life and have worked with them for 17 years. 
I started a pet sitting/dog walking business in 1997 and have been training since 2005. 
I live in Oak Park, Michigan with my husband Robert, our pit bull mix Daisy, the action-packed 
cat Posey, and a 30 year old Amazon Parrot named Petey.

In July of 2008 I adopted my best buddy, a then-4-year-old Tibetan Terrier. Sprocket was close to perfect 
from the start; cute, cuddly, enthusiastic about giving kisses and taking walks. He did have one small 
problem, though: he was a cat chaser!
